A **KEYSTROKE FREQUENCY CALCULATOR** using Python Language. Where *'Pynput'* library is used to count the frequency of each key press.
>[!NOTE]
>The *'Pynput'* library allows you to monitor and control input device, including keyboards.

**INSTALLATION**
>pip install pynput

**EXPLANATION**

1.Import the necessary module from the *'pynput'* library:
>from pynput import keyboard

2.Initialize a dictionary 'key_frequencies' to store the frequency of each key press, and set a limit for the frequency with the variable 'frequency_limit':
>key_frequencies = {}

>frequency_limit = 5

3.Define a function 'on_press' that will be called whenever a key is pressed:
>def on_press(key):

4.Inside the 'on_press' function, attempt to get the character representation of the pressed key. If it's not a printable character (e.g., special keys), convert the key to a string:
>try:

  > > key_str = key.char

>except AttributeError:

  > >key_str = str(key)

5.Update the frequency count for the pressed key in the 'key_frequencies' dictionary:
>key_frequencies[key_str] = key_frequencies.get(key_str, 0) + 1

6.Check if the frequency of the pressed key exceeds the specified limit ('frequency_limit'). If it does, print a message and stop counting:
>if key_frequencies[key_str] >= frequency_limit:

  > >print(f"Key '{key_str}' exceeds the frequency limit of {frequency_limit}!, Counting Stopped.")

   > >return

7.Print the current key frequencies:
>print("Key Frequencies: ", key_frequencies)

8.Set up a keyboard listener using 'keyboard.Listener' and pass the 'on_press' function to it. Start the listener with 'listener.join()':
>with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:

 > >listener.join()

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This script will continue to listen for key presses until a key exceeds the specified frequency limit, at which point it will print a message and stop counting. The key frequencies are continuously updated and displayed during the execution of the script.
